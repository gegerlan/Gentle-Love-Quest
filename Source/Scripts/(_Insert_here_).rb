* To users of scripts

 * When using scripts obtained through online websites,
  create a new section at this position and past the script here.
  (Select "Insert" from the pop-up menu in the left list box.)

 * If the creator of the script has any other special instructions, follow them.

 * As a general rule, scripts for "RPG Maker XP" are not compatible,
  so make sure that you are using an "RPG Maker VX" script.


* To authors of scripts

 * When developing scripts to be distributed to the general public,
  we recommend that you use redefinitions and aliases as much as
  possible, to allow the script to run just by pasting it in this position.
